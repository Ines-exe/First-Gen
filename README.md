This project is a website that allows first generation students to explore certain resources that may help them. This website focuses on providing resources for financial aid, scholarship oppurtunities and mental health issues. This website is set up, through the use of multiple files that each pull up a different page of the website. Using the website is just as simple as seting it up, the user simply clicks on whatever subject or subjects they chose to recieve resources on and they click submit. Doing this will send the user to a different page that has resources for the subjects they were looking for.
